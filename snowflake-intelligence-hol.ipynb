This context will be leveraged by Cortex Analyst for generating SQL to answer natural language questions.\n\nSemantic Views are comprised of the following components:\n\n- **Tables**: logical tables that map to Snowflake tables or views\n- **Facts**: row-level attributes tied to a logical table that represent specific business events or transactions\n- **Dimensions**: categorical attributes tied to a logical table that gives meaning to metrics by grouping data into meaningful categories\n- **Metrics**: quantifiable measures of business performance calculated by aggregating facts or other columns from the same table\n**Named filters**: logic to filter a logical table based on some business rule\n**Relationships**: how logical tables are mapped to one another. This enables Cortex Analyst to join multiple logical tables together\n\nSemantic Views can be created through SQL (as seen below), but also through the Snowsight UI which is what we'll walk through together in this lab."

Cortex Search performs \"hybrid\" search, which is a combination of both vector and keyword search to get the most relevant information for the task at hand. \n\nCortex Search will also handle all of the complexity of managing a hybrid search service, such as the:\n- embedding pipeline\n- serving and storage infrastructure\n- search parameter tuning\n- index refreshes\n\nThis means that you can get high-quality search results through only a few simple SQL statements in Snowflake."
