This context will be leveraged by Cortex Analyst for generating SQL to answer natural language questions.\n\nSemantic Views are comprised of the following components:\n\n- **Tables**: logical tables that map to Snowflake tables or views\n- **Facts**: row-level attributes tied to a logical table that represent specific business events or transactions\n- **Dimensions**: categorical attributes tied to a logical table that gives meaning to metrics by grouping data into meaningful categories\n- **Metrics**: quantifiable measures of business performance calculated by aggregating facts or other columns from the same table\n- **Named filters**: logic to filter a logical table based on some business rule\n- **Relationships**: how logical tables are mapped to one another. This enables Cortex Analyst to join multiple logical tables together\n\nSemantic Views can be created through SQL (as seen below), but also through the Snowsight UI which is what we'll walk through together in this lab."

AI Observability 🔎\n\nAfter asking a few questions to our agent, we can explore Snowflake's built in AI Observability tooling to understand what tools were invoked to accomplish the given tasks.\n\nStart by clicking on 'AI & ML' on the left hand havbar, and then opening 'Cortex Agents' in a new tab. Once on the Cortex Agents screen, choose the 'Risk_Analysis_Agent_Tools' agent. Here, you can see all of the configuration for our agent, including which tools it has available.\n\nNext, click on 'Monitoring' and then choose one of your conversations. This is where we can see all the detail going on behind the scenes. Find a task that used Cortex Analyst - there we can see the exact SQL that was generated and executed to answer the given question. We can see all tool executions here including the input and output which greatly helps in any debugging activities."
